Note: We used and took inspiration from the following tools to get started:

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app): a React boilerplate developed by Facebook
* [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/): to train the ML algorithm to recognize hand gestures
* We took inspiration fro [Meth Meth Method](https://github.com/meth-meth-method/pong) pong game.
